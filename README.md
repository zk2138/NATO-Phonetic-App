# NATO Phonetic Alphabet App

A simple Python desktop application that converts a user-inputted word into its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

## 🔤 What It Does

This app takes a word entered by the user and translates each letter into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet word.  
For example:  
**HELLO** → `H - Hotel | E - Echo | L - Lima | L - Lima | O - Oscar`

## 🖥️ Features

- Intuitive and responsive GUI using Tkinter
- Converts letters to NATO phonetic alphabet in real-time
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters
- Case-insensitive input handling

## 🧩 How It Works

Each letter of the input is mapped to its NATO phonetic equivalent using a predefined dictionary. Only alphabetic characters are processed, and the formatted result is displayed within the GUI window.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zk2138/NATO-Phonetic-App.git
   cd NATO-Phonetic-App
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python nato_phonetic_alphabet_app_gui.py
   ```

> Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. Tkinter comes pre-installed with most standard Python distributions.
